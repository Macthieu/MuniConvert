# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Multilingual UI support with in-app language selection:
  - French and English resources (`Localizable.strings`)
  - language preference persisted in settings
  - translated labels for main interface, statuses, collision policies, summaries and key dialogs
- New app screenshots in `docs/images/` and README visual section.

### Changed

- Swift Package now declares localized resources (`defaultLocalization` + `Resources` processing).
- README updated with screenshots and multilingual usage note.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Official app icon asset committed to the repository:
  - `assets/AppIcon.png` (source image)
- Release packaging now embeds this icon in `MuniConvert.app` via the existing icon pipeline.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Main window layout improvements:
  - left pane content now stays inside the window bounds
  - `HSplitView` divider is now truly resizable (removed narrow max width cap)
  - collision selector labels shortened in segmented control to prevent horizontal overflow

### Added

- App icon pipeline:
  - new `scripts/release/generate_icns.sh` utility
  - automatic `assets/AppIcon.png` -> `assets/AppIcon.icns` conversion during release build
  - `assets/README.md` with icon placement guidelines

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Release packaging fixed to avoid macOS "app is damaged" error on downloaded builds:
  - ad-hoc codesign is now applied to the full `.app` bundle in `build_dist.sh`
  - signature verification is enforced during build packaging
- `Info.plist` version fields are now normalized for macOS compatibility:
  - strip leading `v` from tags (e.g. `v1.0.3` -> `1.0.3`)
  - fallback to valid numeric version components

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions release workflow parsing issue:
  - removed direct `secrets.*` usage inside `if:` expressions
  - switched to `env`-based conditions
- Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) release runs on non-tag refs now succeed:
  - upload generated ZIP as workflow artifact
  - skip GitHub Release publication unless ref is a tag

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Local macOS distribution scripts:
  - `scripts/release/build_dist.sh`
  - `scripts/release/sign_notarize.sh`
- GitHub Actions release workflow:
  - `.github/workflows/release-macos.yml`

  - `docs/MACOS_DISTRIBUTION.md`

- `.gitignore` updated to ignore local `dist/` artifacts

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-11

  - scanner/path utilities
  - ViewModel blockers/profile logic
- GitHub repository health files:

- Build/release operational guide in `docs/BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`

### Changed
